# 🚀 ArgoCD: The Modern CD Solution for Kubernetes

ArgoCD is widely regarded as the go-to Continuous Delivery (CD) tool for Kubernetes, streamlining deployment processes by treating Git as the single source of truth. You define your application's desired state in Git, and ArgoCD ensures the cluster matches that state—automatically.

Unlike traditional push-based tools, ArgoCD uses a **pull-based model** from within the Kubernetes cluster, offering better security, traceability, and control. Major enterprises—including LoveHolidays and CVTE—leverage ArgoCD to manage complex, large-scale deployments reliably.

## 🌐 Overview

Kubernetes, introduced by Google in 2014, has become the standard for container orchestration, automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Now under the Cloud-Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes is actively developed by a vast global community. However, automating the delivery of updates in Kubernetes requires robust CD tools like **ArgoCD**, **FluxCD**, **JenkinsX**, and **GitHub Actions**.

Among these, **ArgoCD stands out** for its declarative GitOps model and enterprise-grade features.

## 🚀 Continuous Delivery in Kubernetes

To achieve automation and consistency in deploying new code versions, teams rely on CD tools built specifically for Kubernetes environments.

**ArgoCD** offers:

- Declarative GitOps workflows  
- Version control for infrastructure and app configs  
- Automated, secure deployment pipelines  

With ArgoCD, everything—manifests, configurations, environment-specific values—is managed **as code** in Git, giving teams full control and auditability.

## 🔧 How ArgoCD Works – GitOps in Action

ArgoCD simplifies Kubernetes deployments using the GitOps model. Here's how it works:

1. **GitOps at the Core**  
   Git stores the desired state of your app.

2. **Define Kubernetes Manifests Using:**
   - Kustomize
   - Helm Charts
   - Jsonnet
   - Plain YAML/JSON
   - Custom plugins

3. **Application Registration**
   - Connect Git repo
   - Define path to manifests
   - Set target cluster and namespace

4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Controller compares desired vs live state

5. **Detects Drift**
   - If mismatch, app marked **OutOfSync**

6. **Syncing the Application**
   - Manual or auto-sync
   - Ensures cluster matches Git

7. **Git Commit = Deployment Version**
   - Deploy via commits, branches, or tags
   - Rollbacks = revert commit

8. **Visual Interface + Audit Logs**
   - UI, CLI, and audit logs for full visibility

9. **Pull-Based Deployment Model**
   - No exposed API keys
   - Secrets not stored in CI/CD tools

🔐 **Security by Design**  
Even if the Git repo is compromised, attackers don’t get access to your cluster.

## 🧠 ArgoCD Architecture

ArgoCD is built on 3 core components:

### 1️⃣ API Server
- Exposes REST/gRPC APIs
- Manages apps, syncs, rollbacks, RBAC
- Handles Git webhooks

### 2️⃣ Repository Server
- Local cache of Git repos
- Renders manifests using:
  - App path
  - Repo URL
  - Revision
  - Templates (e.g., Helm values)

### 3️⃣ Application Controller
- Continuously monitors desired vs live state
- Detects drift and syncs automatically
- Executes sync lifecycle hooks (pre, sync, post)

These components work together to deliver true GitOps automation and resilience.
